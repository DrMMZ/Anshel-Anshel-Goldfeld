# Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld
Implementation of Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld public key protocol in Python

Anshel, I., Anshel, M., & Goldfeld, D. (1999). An algebraic method for public-key cryptography. Mathematical Research Letters, 6, 287-292.

We implement the Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld protocol using the free group of rank 2; and this can be easily extended to any free group of finite rank. Two prgrams AAG-A.py and AAG-B.py are implemented for Alice and Bob, respectively.
